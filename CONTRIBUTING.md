## What to do to contribute

You can contribute by improving the existing algorithm, or implementing a new endpoint for another piece in the Chess game, if so, you can just create a new class and extend it from the base class BoardProccessor, insert a new route and create a new controller to handle the request.

You can also improve the frontend web application [here](https://github.com/rayashi/masterchess).
